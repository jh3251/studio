/**
 * This ruleset enforces a multi-tiered security model for the SumBook app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * 1. Admin Users: Own and manage multiple 'stores'. They have full CRUD access to
 *    their own stores and all data nested within them.
 * 2. Store Users: Have access to ONLY ONE specific store. Their credentials are
 *    created by the admin. They can read and write data only within that store.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /user_roles/{uid}: A top-level collection mapping a Firebase Auth UID to a role.
 *   - Doc Data: { role: 'admin' } OR { role: 'store', storeId: '...', adminId: '...' }
 * - /users/{adminId}/stores/{storeId}/...: All business data is nested under the
 *   admin who owns it. This ensures data isolation between different admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access must be explicitly granted.
 * - Role-Based Access: A user's role is fetched from `/user_roles` at the beginning
 *   of a request to determine their permissions.
 * - Admin Ownership: An admin can only access data under their own `/users/{adminId}` path.
 * - Store User Scoping: A store user's access is scoped to a single store path,
 *   determined by the `storeId` and `adminId` in their user_role document.
